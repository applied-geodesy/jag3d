Java·Applied·Geodesy·3D
=======================
JAG3D (Java Applied Geodesy 3D) is one of the most popular open source least-squares software package for geodetic sciences. The Java-based application is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License (version 3). JAG3D is designed to combine hybrid terrestrial observations like leveling, directions, distances or vertical angles in a uniform and rigorous mathematical model. Moreover, GNSS baselines that are derived by Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) techniques are supported. Some reference projects are the [deformation analysis](https://software.applied-geodesy.org/en/deformation_analysis) at the Onsala Space Observatory, or the adjustment of laser tracker measurements at the [electron accelerator](https://software.applied-geodesy.org/en/electron_accelerator) S-DALINAC. More information about the least-squares software package JAG3D can be found at [software.applied-geodesy.org](https://software.applied-geodesy.org/)</a>.

System requirements
-------------------
JAG3D is written in the platform-independent programming language Java and, therefore, the software is runnable at each platform and operation system that provides a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and the [JavaFX](https://openjfx.io). JavaFX is included to the provided bundles. Moreover, the windows download package of JAG3D contains [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net). For that reason, neither Java nor the platform dependent FX extension must be provided by the windows operating system. To run JAG3D on other platforms such as Linux or MacOS, the platform dependent JRE must be installed at the operating system. The JRE can be found for several platforms at Oracles [download page](https://java.oracle.com) or at the [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net)-project pages.


Support and Installation
------------------------
JAG3D is a portable least-squares software package - no need to install or uninstall. Just [download the latest version](https://github.com/loesler/applied-geodesy/releases/latest), unpack and run. The JAG3D manual is organized by a [Wiki](https://software.applied-geodesy.org/wiki/). Moreover, a [support forum](https://software.applied-geodesy.org/forum/) is available for technical support.
